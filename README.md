# burger
 Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
 Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the page -- waiting to be devoured.
 Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the  side of the page.
 This is a burger logger app with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!).
 Using the MVC design pattern; I use Node and MySQL to query and route data in my app, and Handlebars to generate my HTML.
